# Ugandan Warrior Bot

Meme telegram bot project in node.js

## Getting it to work:
* Enter your bot token in config.js

* Build the dependencies with `npm install` otherwise it wont work, obviously.

* use debug.bat while developing to get automatic restarts with nodemon on code change and debug messages from telegraf:api

#TODO:
- [x] Automatically delete leaked bot tokens
- [ ] Get good ideas
